# Quantum Cryptography Simulation

Welcome to my Quantum Cryptography Simulation. This is a summative I have worked on for my Grade 12 Physics class. This simulation is based off the BB84 Protocol. This protocol was made by Charles Bennnett and Gilles Brassard. We are going to use the way light travels through vertical and horizontal states to send encrypted messages using an algorithm similar to this:
